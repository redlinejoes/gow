# In order to use Vulkan with NVIDIA GPUs, the ICD file must be present (so
# Vulkan knows how to find the driver libraries).  Although the nvidia runtime
# _does_ handle making the actual drivers available, it doesn't install the ICD
# JSON.  So we provide one ourselves.  This is harmless on non-NVIDIA systems,
# so we just do it unconditionally.
# NOTE: as of nvidia-container-toolkit v1.12, this is no longer necessary. once
# that version is sufficiently widely available, we may want to make it a
# requirement and stop doing this manually
